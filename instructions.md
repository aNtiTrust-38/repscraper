# FashionReps Scraper - Implementation Instructions

## FEASIBILITY CONFIRMATION: âœ… PROJECT IS FULLY VIABLE

This project is **100% technically feasible** and represents an excellent solution for monitoring FashionReps content. The comprehensive plan above provides a roadmap from basic MVP to enterprise-grade system.

## CRITICAL CLARIFYING QUESTIONS

Before beginning implementation, please provide answers to these essential questions:

### 1. Project Scope & Requirements
- **Primary Use Case:** Is this for personal use only, or do you plan to share with other users?
- **Volume Expectations:** How many posts per day do you expect to process? (FashionReps gets ~50-100 relevant posts daily)
- **Response Time:** How quickly do you need notifications? (Real-time, within 5 minutes, hourly batches?)
- **Platform Priority:** Which shopping platforms are most important to you? (Taobao, Weidian, 1688, Yupoo, Pandabuy, etc.)

### 2. Feature Priorities  
- **Essential Features:** What are your must-have features for V1? (Basic link extraction, quality filtering, specific platforms?)
- **Nice-to-Have Features:** What features would you like eventually but aren't critical initially?
- **User Interface:** Do you prefer simple text notifications or rich interactive messages with buttons and images?
- **Filtering Preferences:** Do you want filtering by price range, item categories, post quality, etc.?

### 3. Technical Preferences
- **Development Complexity:** Do you prefer a simple script or a robust, scalable system?
- **Hosting:** Where do you plan to run this? (Local computer, cloud server, always-on vs scheduled runs?)
- **Database:** Do you need data persistence, or is real-time processing sufficient?
- **Configuration:** How much customization do you want? (Simple config file vs advanced admin interface?)

### 4. Integration Requirements
- **Telegram Setup:** Do you want messages sent to you personally, a private channel, or a group?
- **Multiple Users:** Will anyone else use this system, or is it single-user only?
- **Data Export:** Do you need ability to export/analyze collected data?
- **External Integrations:** Any integration needs with shopping calculators, price converters, etc.?

### 5. Operational Considerations
- **Maintenance:** How much time can you dedicate to maintaining/updating the system?
- **Budget:** Any constraints on hosting costs or third-party services?
- **Monitoring:** Do you need system health monitoring and alerts?
- **Updates:** How often do you want new features and improvements?

## RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

Based on typical user needs, I recommend starting with **Phase 1 MVP approach**:

### MVP Features (Week 1-2 Implementation)
1. **Basic Reddit Monitoring:** Monitor r/FashionReps for new posts with relevant flairs
2. **Core Link Extraction:** Extract links from top 5 platforms (Taobao, Weidian, 1688, Yupoo, Pandabuy)
3. **Simple Telegram Notifications:** Clean, readable messages with extracted links
4. **Basic Filtering:** Remove obvious spam and low-quality posts
5. **Duplicate Prevention:** Don't send same post multiple times

### Next Steps After MVP
Once MVP is working and you've validated the concept:
- Add advanced filtering and quality scoring
- Implement user preferences and customization
- Add rich interactive Telegram features
- Expand platform support
- Add data persistence and analytics

## GETTING STARTED CHECKLIST

Before implementation begins, complete these steps:

### 1. Reddit API Setup
- [ ] Create Reddit account (if needed)
- [ ] Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
- [ ] Click "Create App" or "Create Another App"  
- [ ] Choose "script" type
- [ ] Set redirect URI to `http://localhost:8080`
- [ ] Note down: client_id, client_secret, user_agent

### 2. Telegram Bot Setup
- [ ] Open Telegram and message @BotFather
- [ ] Send `/newbot` command
- [ ] Choose bot name and username
- [ ] Note down bot token
- [ ] Get your chat_id by messaging @userinfobot

### 3. Development Environment
- [ ] Confirm Python 3.9+ installed
- [ ] Decide on hosting location (local computer, cloud server, etc.)
- [ ] Choose code editor/IDE preference
- [ ] Set up version control (Git repository)

### 4. Configuration Decisions
- [ ] Monitoring frequency (every 5 minutes, 15 minutes, hourly?)
- [ ] Quality thresholds (minimum upvotes, comment count, etc.)
- [ ] Platform priorities (which shopping sites to focus on first?)
- [ ] Notification preferences (message format, timing, batching?)

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

The project will be considered successful when:
- [ ] Successfully monitors r/FashionReps without rate limiting issues  
- [ ] Extracts links from 90%+ of relevant posts
- [ ] Sends clean, useful Telegram notifications
- [ ] Runs reliably with minimal maintenance
- [ ] Provides clear value to user experience

## SUPPORT & MAINTENANCE

After initial implementation:
- **Regular Updates:** Reddit/Telegram APIs may change
- **Platform Evolution:** Shopping sites update URL formats
- **Community Changes:** FashionReps rules or patterns may evolve
- **Feature Requests:** Based on usage experience
